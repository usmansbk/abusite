## Usage assumptions and concepts

An Event can be a lecture, test, or public event.

A User can be a student or staff. Each user can create events. Users do not have followers or any direct connection with each other like other social media apps.

Events can be organized into groups and shared with other users. Users can save individual or grouped events and receive live updates and offline reminders.

Users can also pay a fee to advertise their public events to a larger audience based on their interests.
